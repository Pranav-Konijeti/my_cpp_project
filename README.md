# This is my c++ project.

This project is for my CS 1000 class.

There is no need to install markdown, it is automatically implemented in many areas.

1. You can make lists like this.
2. It will automatically number when you click enter.
   
To create a paragraph, you just need an empty line to seperate text.
You can also make text **bold** or *italic*.
